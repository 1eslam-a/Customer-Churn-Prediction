# üìä Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn using Python, scikit-learn, and SMOTE. The project handles real-world imbalanced data and is ready for deployment or integration in apps or APIs.

## üìå Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem in telecom and subscription-based industries. This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to predict if a customer is likely to churn based on historical behavior and subscription details.

## üöÄ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Handling imbalanced data using **SMOTE**
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression (threshold-tuned)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation (recall-focused)
- Exporting pipeline and encoders for deployment

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is a telecom customer dataset containing features like:
- Demographics (gender, senior citizen)
- Account info (tenure, contract type)
- Service usage (internet service, tech support)
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)

> Data file: `es.csv` (not included here for licensing/privacy reasons)

## üß† Models & Evaluation

| Model               | Recall (Churn) | Precision (Churn) | Notes                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | **94%**        | 41%               | High recall after lowering threshold to 0.4            |
| KNN                 | 93%            | 68%               | Balanced performance                                   |
| SVM                 | N/A            | N/A               | Comparable, tuned with `C=3.0` and class weights       |

> Final model: **Logistic Regression**, due to its high recall, which is critical in churn prediction tasks.
